# SongSpy

## Description

SongSpy is a web application that utilizes advanced audio extraction techniques to analyze the timbre and other acoustic features of a song. It employs machine learning techniques to train and identify patterns specific to different artists. By examining characteristics such as tonal quality, instrument sounds, and rhythmic patterns, the model can accurately classify the artist behind a given piece of music. It also includes a feature to determine if the song is artificially generated by comparing it to the artist's current music catalogue.
