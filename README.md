# ArtistClassifier


Using advanced audio extraction techniques, this model analyzes the timbre and 
other acoustic features of songs to train and learn patterns specific to different artists. 
By examining characteristics such as tonal quality, instrument sounds, 
and rhythmic patterns, the model can accurately classify the artist behind a 
given piece of music. Once the model determines which artist the song belongs to, it will then compare
to the Artist's current catalogue of music, determining if the song is artificially generated or not.
